    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is 
      the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages.
      HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML
      specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML
      and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but
      currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this
      version was published in 2012.</p>

    <p>
      HTML is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer
      specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
      I will list down some of the key advantages of learning HTML:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Create Web site </b>  -You can create a website or customize an existing web template if you know HTML well.</li>

  <!-- Elements-->
  <section class="main_sec" id="elements">
    <header><h1>Elements</h1></header>
    <p>An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content,
       it ends with a closing tag, where the element name is preceded
       by a forward slash as shown below with few tags
      
       
        <pre>
          <h1><u>Elements Examples</u></h1>
          
          
            &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading.&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;This is a list item.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;This is a list item.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        
          
        </pre>

      <ul id="ulelements">
        <li>To display code use the pre element </li>
        <li>Text in a pre element is displayed in a fixed-width font,
           and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks.
           The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>HTML uses a text-based format to provide structure and style to the web page. As it is a
      markup language,it uses tags to define a structure and style.And Hypertext means that HTML 
      can contain text that, when clicked, can redirect you to a new page. For example, 
      whenever you click on any link on the web page, that link redirects you to the new web page. 
      That functionality is known as Hypertext.Thus HTML is used to make web pages and web applications by providing 
      the structure and styling with the help of tags.

        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>




      HTML5 is an advanced version of HTML. It contains
      all the features of HTML along with new tags like  video, audio and canvas elements . There are also tags for including semantics, 
      and these tags are article, header, footer etc. HTML5 improves the HTML to support the latest multimedia and new 
      features, including graphics, music, etc.

    <p>HTML is the primary markup language found on the internet. Every HTML page has a series of 
      elements that create the content structure of a web page or application. 

      HTML is a beginner-friendly language with plenty of support and is mainly used for static 
      website pages. HTML works best together with CSS for the styling and JavaScript for the 
      functionality</p>
