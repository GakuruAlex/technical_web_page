    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is 
      the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages.
      HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML
      specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML
      and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but
      currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this
      version was published in 2012.</p>
